# Green-Css-Theme

The "All Green" CSS theme is a theme created by u/BroderzYt. As you probably guessed it makes your subreddit all green. Install instructions can be found in the "installation" folder

Demo subreddit: ~~r/BroderzYtPlus~~ 

(**NOTE**: I HAD TO USE THIS SUBREDDIT FOR ANOTHER CSS THEME I AM WORKING ON, SO R/BRODERZYTPLUS NO LONGER HAS THE "ALL GREEN" CSS THEME INSTALLED ON IT. SORRY FOR THE INCONVINIENCE)

If you have any questions about this theme or how to install it, then don't hesitate to PM me (u/BroderzYt)
